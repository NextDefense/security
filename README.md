# take a look at these tools for the testing suite

there are several open-source tools and frameworks that can help identify both website vulnerabilities and data storage vulnerabilities. Here are a few notable ones:

# OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):

Description: An open-source web application security scanner. It helps find security vulnerabilities in your web applications during development and testing.
Website: OWASP ZAP
Capabilities: Scans for a wide range of vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.

# Burp Suite Community Edition:

Description: A popular web vulnerability scanner with both free (Community) and paid (Professional) versions. The Community Edition offers many basic features.
Website: Burp Suite
Capabilities: Manual and automated web vulnerability scanning, including data storage vulnerabilities.

# Bandit:

Description: A tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. It is particularly useful for identifying data storage vulnerabilities in Python applications.
Website: Bandit
Capabilities: Scans Python code for security issues such as hardcoded passwords, potential SQL injections, and more.

# SonarQube:

Description: An open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
Website: SonarQube
Capabilities: Supports multiple programming languages and can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities including those related to data storage.

# TruffleHog:

Description: A tool for searching through git repositories for high entropy strings and secrets, such as passwords, API keys, etc.
Website: TruffleHog
Capabilities: Detects secrets and sensitive data that may be accidentally committed to version control.

# Semgrep:

Description: A static analysis tool that can be used to find security vulnerabilities and enforce code standards. It supports custom rules and patterns.
Website: Semgrep
